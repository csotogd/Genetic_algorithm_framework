#Genetic Algorithm framework:
We developed a genetic algorithm framework. One can use it by just defining the individuals, crossover and mutation method in your implementation.
We try our program for the 0-1 knapsack problem and the travelling salesman problem.

Please see main_TSP.py for an example.
